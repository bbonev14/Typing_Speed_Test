# Typing_Speed_Test
Simple typing speed test built with tkinter

## Info
This project uses tkinter for it's interface. It will accept any keyboard input an will start a timer. Upon receiving an input keystroke that is equal to the letter that's displayed, it will accept it and move to the next one. It will count the percentage of accuracy of the inputs it receives. After 60 seconds have passed it will stop and 
display your results.

## Personalization
* TEXTS - can accept any number of strings. The length of the strings should be long enough so that it cannot be written in under 6o seconds.
* on_key_press() - on line 61 you can change the timer to whatever length you choose.
